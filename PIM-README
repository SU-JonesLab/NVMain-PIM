# Processing In Memory (PIM) Extension for RTSim

This is a README for the Processing In Memory (PIM) extension, which is built on top of the RTSim simulator (which in turn is built on top of the NVMain simulator).

## New Command Types

The PIM extension introduces three new command types from the PIM command set:

1. **Overlapped Activate (OA)**: This command allows for the activation of a row while another row is already active. This can be useful for cloning the contents of one row to another.

2. **Triple Row Activate (TRA)**: This command activates three rows at once. This is meant to perform the majority operation on the 3 elements column-wise, across the row. State is not tracked in this simulator so we model energy and latency.

3. **Double Row Activate (DRA)**: This command activates two rows at once. This command can be used in Ambit (DRAM) PIM or Pinatubo (RRAM) PIM.
    In order to simulate the sequential wordline driver for Pinatubo, need to add tRCD * #DRA to final timing.

4. **Local Write (LW)**: This command writes the contents of the sense amps (SA) back into the address given using local write drivers.

4. **RowClone_PSM**: This command is intended to clone a row in a PSM (Pipelined Serial Mode) manner. However, this feature is not yet implemented.

## Results

The following table compares the energy consumption for our implementation of each operation to the Ambit reported energy:

| Operation | Energy Consumption Ambit (nJ/KB) | Energy Consumption Us (nJ/KB) | Percent Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NOT | 1.6 | 1.7 |  +6% |
| AND | 3.2 | 3.17 | -1% |
| NAND | 4.0 | 3.59 | -10% |
| XOR | 5.5 | 5.24 | -5% |

Please note: The energy consumption for our implementation is based off the "2D_DRAM_example.config" which implements the Micron DDR3-1333_4Gb_8B_x8 memory chip, which has a row-size of 8KB.
